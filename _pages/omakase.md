  Embark on a sensory journey with Yūgen Omakase, where contemporary Japanese
  and Australian culinary techniques blend seamlessly. With only 6 seats at our
  intimate mezzanine bar, Chef Samuel Chee and our expert Sushi Chefs guide you
  through a personalized, multi-course exploration of the finest seasonal and
  ocean-fresh produce. Each bite-sized course is prepared right before your
  eyes, offering an immersive dining experience.


  Proudly awarded Two Hats for the third consecutive year in the 2025 Good Food
  Guide Awards, Yūgen Omakase offers an unforgettable dining experience that
  celebrates craftsmanship, precision, and is complemented by elevated beverage
  pairings.


  Due to the intricacy of this experience we are unable to provide a menu free
  from raw items, gluten, dairy, egg and shellfish, or for those seeking a fully
  vegetarian, vegan or halal menu, we respectfully ask that you kindly
  reconsider your booking, as our menu may not be suitable. We sincerely
  appreciate your understanding and consideration. If you have any concerns
  regarding dietary requirements, please contact our team at info\@yugen.com.au
  or 03 7000 3232.
