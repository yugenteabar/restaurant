  Yugen offers a modern take on omakase tradition. A melding of culinary
  techniques born in Japan, refined in Australia.


  We deliver omakase dining with community at its core. Relationships formed
  with guests, and producers, create a memorable, intimate experience. A
  showcase of the finest produce from Australia and Japan, sourced without
  compromise, and tailored specifically for you.


  With only six seats at our mezzanine bar, Alex Yu will guide you through a
  dedicated, evolving showcase. Memorable dishes made using the highest quality
  produce turn first time guests into family. A mutual experience of trust and
  discovery, to satisfy your senses in new and profound ways.

  Yugen Omakase starts at 7:00 pm sharp for all diners; please arrive before to
  ensure the best dining experience for all Omakase guests. Unfortunately the
  Chefâ€™s cannot cater for missed dishes for late guests as it will affect other
  guests experiences. Omakase is dependent on seasonal produce and changes
  daily, for this reason, we are unable to cater for food allergies and/or
  dietary restrictions. This is also due to the potential traces of allergens in
  the supplied ingredients and in the work environment. Please note:
  cancellations within 48 hours of your booking date/no shows will be charged a
  $285 cancellation fee per person.
