  Yugen offers a modern take on omakase tradition. A melding of culinary
  techniques born in Japan, refined in Australia.


  We deliver omakase dining with community at its core. Relationships formed
  with guests, and producers, create a memorable, intimate experience. A
  showcase of the finest produce from Australia and Japan, sourced without
  compromise, and tailored specifically for you.


  With only six seats at our mezzanine bar, Alex Yu will guide you through a
  dedicated, evolving showcase. Memorable dishes made using the highest quality
  produce turn first time guests into family. A mutual experience of trust and
  discovery, to satisfy your senses in new and profound ways.

  Terms and Conditions: 

  Omakase starts at 7pm sharp. For the best dining experience, please ensure all
  guests arrive at 15 min before. 

  Unfortunately, Chef cannot accommodate for late guests and will not supply
  missed dishes. 

  Our Omakase is dependant on seasonal produce and changes daily. For this
  reason, we are unable to cater to food allergies and/or dietary restrictions.
  This is also due to the potential traces of allergens in the supplied
  ingredients and in the work environment. 

  Please note: Cancellations within 48 hours of your booking date/no shows will
  be charged a $285 cancellation fee per person.
