    event_title: Mother's Day at Yūgen
    event_description: >-
      This Mother's Day, let's make it special for the amazing mother figure in
      your life with a day at Yūgen.

       Imagine starting with a peaceful afternoon tea at our Yūgen Tea Bar, where we serve a variety of premium teas, tempting sweet and savory bites, and even some bubbly Champagne. 

      Then, post-tea, head down to the Yūgen Dining. Here, you can savour our
      carefully prepared dishes that masterfully mix traditional Asian tastes
      with a modern spin, all set in our unique underground setting. 


      This Mother's Day, choose Yūgen, where every moment is a warm celebration
      of love and gratitude. We can't wait to see you there!
