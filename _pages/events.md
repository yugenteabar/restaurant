    event_description: |-
      For one night, Yūgen breaks the rules. Inspired by Tokyo’s tachinomi bars, expect standing-room energy–swift plates, flowing drinks and a space that never stands still. No reservations. No schedules. Arrive when you like and stay as long as you please.

      Drift through every level as Tokyo-inspired beats set the pace. Sashimi and nigiri prepared on the spot, yakitori straight from the grill, izakaya bites in constant rotation and mini cocktails making the rounds. This isn’t dinner — it’s a night out. 

      Ticket includes continuous access to the full selection of food and beverages throughout the evening, inviting you to indulge at your own pace.

      Part of the Melbourne Food & Wine Festival 2026 Program.
