    event_title: TACHIYUGEN
    event_description: >-
      For one night, Yūgen breaks the rules. Inspired by Tokyo’s tachinomi bars,
      this is standing-room energy—fast plates, flowing drinks and a room that
      never sits still. No reservations. No schedules. Come and go as you
      please.


      Move through every level as live Tokyo-inspired beats pulse around you.
      Sashimi and nigiri on the spot, yakitori straight off the grill, izakaya
      bites in constant rotation and mini cocktails that keep coming.


      This isn’t dinner. It’s a night out. Miss it, and it’s gone.


      General Admission tickets: $180


      Part of the Melbourne Food & Wine Festival 2026 Program.
