      Join us for another exclusive chapter in our dinner series as Yugen teams
      up with Glenfiddich, the world’s most awarded single malt Scotch whisky.

      rarest and most exceptional aged releases. Ross will share the tales,
      tasting notes and insights that brought each dram to life.


      From the elegance of the 18yo to the richness of the 26yo, every sip will
      be matched with a 4-course tasting menu that highlights Glenfiddich
      whisky’s character and complexity.
