      Join us for an exclusive new chapter in our dinner series as Yugen teams

      Hosted by Glenfiddich Brand Ambassador, Ross Blainey, this intimate
      evening will take you on a guided journey through some of the distillery’s
      rarest and most exceptional aged releases. Ross will share the tales,
      tasting notes and insights that brought each dram to life.
