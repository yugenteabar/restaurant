    event_title: TACHIYUGEN
    event_description: >-
      For one night only, Yūgen transforms into a tachinomi–Japan’s lively,
      no-reservations standing bars where food moves fast, drinks flow freely,
      and the atmosphere crackles with energy. Explore three dynamic levels,
      each alive with flavour, sound and live music inspired by Tokyo’s
      legendary listening bars. Mini cocktails circulate alongside sashimi,
      nigiri, yakitori and izakaya-style bites throughout the night. Drop in for
      a drink or stay and soak it all in. 

      General Admission tickets: $180
