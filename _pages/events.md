    event_title: 'High Tea & Ink: A Creative Workshop with Junko Azukawa'
    event_description: >-
      Learn the elegant brush techniques of Sumi-e (ink painting) with Junko
      Azukawa in a unique 90-minute Japanese ink painting workshop in Yugen.
      Rooted in simplicity and mindfulness, Sumi-e is more than art — it’s a
      meditative practice that invites calm, focus, and self-expression. After
      the workshop, head upstairs to YTB to enjoy a bespoke high tea menu,
      inspired by Junko’s creative style and artwork.


      Whether you're new to art or simply seeking a moment of calm, this
      workshop offers a beautiful way to slow down, connect, and indulge.
