    event_description: >-
      Step beneath the golden glow of 10,000 suspended globes as Yūgen joins
      forces with Doot Doot Doot for an extraordinary one-night-only
      collaboration.


      In a rare creative exchange, our Culinary Director Stephen Nairn brings
      the essence of Yūgen to the Mornington Peninsula — reimagined through a
      tasting menu defined by precision, poetry, and bold reinterpretation.


      This event is part of Jackalope Weekend — a celebration of food, art, and
      cultural expression — where nothing is ordinary, and everything is
      unforgettable.
