  Yūgen is open for dinner Wednesday to Sunday, from 6:00pm until late.


  We offer two seating sessions at 6:00pm or 8:15pm, with a 2-hour dining period
  for first sitting reservations. 


  Our à la carte menu is served in the dining room on both standard and high-top
  tables, while our mezzanine is reserved exclusively for the Chef’s Experience
  menu at $180 per person.

  Online reservations are available for up to 12 guests, with groups of 7 or
  more invited to enjoy our Yūgen Banquet.


  For larger groups, our Reservations Team will be delighted to assist.

  Omakase reservations can be made via our dedicated Omakase page.
   
  All reservations are for full dining experiences, while our bar remains open
  for walk-ins to enjoy drinks and snacks.


  A minimum spend of $80 per person applies to Friday and Saturday reservations
  and every evening in December.

  We understand plans change, to avoid cancellation fees of $80 per person for à
  la carte or $180 per person for the Chef’s Experience, we kindly ask that any
  changes or cancellations are made at least 24 hours in advance.
   
  For the comfort of all guests, flash photography is not permitted.

  Outside food and beverages, including cakes, cannot be brought into the
  restaurant.

  A 10% surcharge applies on Sundays and 15% on public holidays.
   
  Reservations can be made anytime online, or by contacting our team at
  info@yugen.com.au or on (03) 7000 3232 from Tuesday to Saturday, 9:30am to
  5:30pm.


  See you underground.
