  Leave your world behind. Dine, drink, and move with us. The night has just
  begun.

  Yugen is influenced by the cultural richness of Asia, inspired by tradition,
  but not bound by it.


  Start by taking your night underground. Six-metre-high stone walls and refined
  industrial interiors abound with three distinct areas for you to savour:

      A lower dining room offers considered dishes, bold flavours, the sizzling
      accent of umami, and late nights.
  - experience_title: Omakase Bar

      A six-seat mezzanine omakase bar introduces the finest of tradition to
      modern instinct.
  - experience_title: Golden Orb

      Our six to nine seat golden orb brings everyone together and provides the
      ultimate vantage point to see the night unfold.
