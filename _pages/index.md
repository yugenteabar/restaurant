  Hidden beneath the vibrant streets of South Yarra, guests descend via a

  design-led space with six-metre-high ceilings and ambient golden light. Yūgen
  presents a curated selection of elevated dining experiences—including an
  85-seat fine dining modern Japanese and Asian Fusion restaurant, a cocktail
  bar, the exclusive six-seat Yūgen Omakase, and the Golden Orb: a suspended VIP
