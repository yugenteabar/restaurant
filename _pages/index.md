  culinary scene.
text_after_title: >-
  Hidden beneath the vibrant streets of South Yarra, guests descend via a
  dramatic glass-walled lift or illuminated staircase into a cavernous,
  design-led space with six-metre-high ceilings and ambient golden light. Yūgen
  presents a curated selection of elevated dining experiences—including an
  85-seat fine dining modern Japanese and Asian Fusion restaurant, a cocktail
  bar, the exclusive six-seat Yūgen Omakase, and the Golden Orb: a suspended VIP
  dining space offering a truly unique experience.
