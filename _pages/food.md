      Our à la carte menu is led by the five senses, marked not just by what is
      tasted, but what is seen, heard, touched, and smelt.


      Our menu draws from the cultural richness of Asia, dishes depart from
      convention and arrive at the meeting point of flavour and texture. A
      far-reaching offering held togetherby the common thread of a roaring open
      fire.

      night unforgettable.
