          Yugen offers beverages that showcase the diverse produce of its dishes. A way to explore the intimately

          Using preserving, dehydrating, and fermenting techniques that began in Asian cuisine, Yugen marries modern
          tastes with traditional produce. Shiso vinegar as a drinking shrub. Aromatised plum wine to create a fusion,
          sweet vermouth. Drinks noted by Japanese citrus in place of traditional lemons and limes.
        </p>
        <p>
          An offering influenced by history, interpreted for now. Beverages that tell the stories of tiki drinks in
          Asia, and trace diplomatic relationships. Tastes that admire the past, and look forward to right now.

          Yugen offers twenty sakes by the glass divided into six, distinct categories. Prefecture to prefecture,
          textured to creamy, savory to robust, lighter to heavier, Junmai to Kijoshu. A tale of sakeâ€™s diversity told
          by the expertise of our in-house sake sommeliers. If a glass tempts you towards more, we have 50 by the bottle
          options to share.
