  Yugen offers a modern take on omakase tradition. A melding of culinary techniques born in Japan, refined in Australia.

  We deliver omakase dining with community at its core. Relationships formed with guests, and producers, create a memorable, intimate experience. A showcase of the finest produce from Australia and Japan, sourced without compromise, and tailored specifically for you.

  With only six seats at our mezzanine bar, Alex Yu will guide you through a dedicated, evolving showcase. Memorable dishes made using the highest quality produce turn first time guests into family. A mutual experience of trust and discovery, to satisfy your senses in new and profound ways.
